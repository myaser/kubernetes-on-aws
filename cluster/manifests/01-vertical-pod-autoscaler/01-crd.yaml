                  VerticalPodAutoscaler can be targeted at controller implementing
                  scale subresource (the pod set is retrieved from the controller's
                  ScaleStatus) or some well known controllers (e.g. for DaemonSet
                  the pod set is read from the controller's spec). If VerticalPodAutoscaler
                  cannot use specified target it will report ConfigUnsupported condition.
                  Note that VerticalPodAutoscaler does not require full implementation
                  of scale subresource - it will not use it to modify the replica
                  count. The only thing retrieved is a label selector matching pods
                  grouped by the target resource.
